Deciding which sample to present by choosing an item in `/sampleCounts`\n   * that has been seen the least number of times, but also making sure the user\n   * hasn't seen that sample yet (by reading from `/userSeenSamples/<username>`).\n   * 2. sending the user's response from the widget. This includes:\n   *   1. getting feedback from the widget and displaying it.\n   *   2. saving the response and the time it took to make the response\n   *      (pushes to `/votes` in firebase)\n       3. Updating the user's score\n       4. Updating that sample's count\n       5. Updating that the user has seen the sample\n       6. Updating that sample's summary\n       7.
